CRITICAL THINKING QUESTION
===========================================================

QUESTION:
Explain why login functionality MUST be implemented using PHP (server-side) 
rather than JavaScript (client-side). Identify at least three specific 
security risks.

ANSWER:
Implementing a login system requires a high level of security that only 
server-side processing can provide. The fundamental reason is that 
PHP (server-side) executes on the web server, keeping the logic and 
sensitive data hidden from the user, whereas JavaScript (client-side) 
runs directly on the user's browser, making it completely transparent 
and modifiable.

SPECIFIC SECURITY RISKS OF USING JAVASCRIPT FOR LOGIN:

1. Source Code Exposure: 
   Since JavaScript is sent to the client's browser, any user can easily 
   view the authentication logic or hardcoded credentials by using 
   "View Page Source" or Developer Tools (F12).

2. Authentication Bypass: 
   A malicious user can modify the JavaScript code locally in their 
   browser. For example, they could change a conditional check like 
   'if (isValidUser)' to always be 'true', allowing them to bypass 
   the password verification entirely.

3. Database Credential Leakage: 
   To verify credentials via client-side JavaScript, the application 
   would need to expose database connection strings or API keys to 
   the browser, giving attackers direct access to the entire 
   database.

4. Insecure Data Handling: 
   Using client-side logic requires bringing sensitive user data 
   (like hashed passwords for comparison) into the browser's memory, 
   where it is vulnerable to memory-scraping malware or 
   unauthorized access.

CONCLUSION:
Server-side processing is essential for protecting sensitive data 
because it acts as a "black box" where credentials can be safely 
verified against a database without exposing the underlying 
security mechanisms to the end-user.
